Differences between video and my project:
- My server.js file was called index.js in video
- My structure has separation of interests between routes, controllers and queries. Model View Controller pattern used (different files and folders used for each).
- "window.location = "/" removed from InputTodo.js, as it reloads page. Instead I used setDescription("") to reset value. Video 50:51
